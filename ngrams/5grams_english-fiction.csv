not the only one who,147893
if she was going to,147827
any information storage and retrieval,147512
you have to do is,147272
a knock at the door,147255
I want you to be,147093
"in the morning , and",147069
I am not going to,147002
in the United States of,146970
not for the first time,146846
he had no idea what,146779
the fact that he had,146446
it 's good to see,146319
did not want to do,146242
was not the first time,145841
and did not want to,145746
you will not be able,145265
"to him , and he",145187
not remember the last time,145010
there 's a lot of,144997
do not have time to,144665
"by the way , I",144557
an hour and a half,144557
this was going to be,144024
spent a lot of time,143703
to figure out how to,143551
on the part of the,143447
when was the last time,143441
I did not think it,143357
at the beginning of the,143313
she would not be able,143276
to spend the rest of,143265
at the top of his,143192
wrapped his arms around her,143067
the rest of your life,142883
do not get me wrong,142426
was in the middle of,142275
she was the one who,142232
why do not you just,142231
at the time of the,142169
you ' re going to,142042
made her way to the,142022
I did not have the,141957
back in his chair and,141869
she felt as if she,141868
of the corner of her,141841
I might be able to,141771
closed the door behind him,141769
of this publication may be,141755
in the shape of a,141497
do not think I 'm,141447
are not you going to,141395
she did not say anything,141326
other end of the line,141277
I do not really know,141181
I 've been thinking about,141131
as if he did not,140840
to be one of the,140623
I can not do it,140490
into the back of the,140460
as far as he could,140378
he was going to do,140369
I 'm not so sure,140262
do not think that 's,140217
no part of this publication,140080
I do not want any,139942
do not know how long,139923
the top of his head,139587
I think it would be,139418
was on the verge of,139179
but I 'm going to,139020
the blink of an eye,138896
was one of the most,138823
he 's going to be,138132
I do not think there,138073
do you want to do,138040
in front of the house,137997
this publication may be reproduced,137966
as they made their way,137915
the end of the hall,137759
"to say something , but",137636
to come up with a,137356
put his arm around her,137322
every once in a while,137183
"in the world , and",137171
the front door of the,137132
part of this publication may,137119
what 's going to happen,136977
but I do not have,136819
"characters , places , and",136602
what it was like to,136384
on his way to the,136165
"by any means , electronic",135964
"a long time , and",135780
What do you know about,135771
and I want you to,135720
I can not do this,135705
the end of the week,135630
"for a moment , he",135415
to be the one to,135373
she was not sure she,135226
I do not get it,135122
I 'm sure you 'll,135055
as fast as he could,135002
"in the air , and",134960
written permission of the publisher,134810
she opened her mouth to,134791
for the first time that,134742
with the back of his,134736
the hell are you doing,134673
she did not know if,134666
nothing to do with it,134617
What do you want me,134566
I know what you 're,134517
for a couple of days,134402
as if he 'd been,134309
did not have to be,134302
and walked over to the,134249
was only a matter of,134146
his head in his hands,134051
they looked at each other,134001
do not even know what,133833
but he did not know,133805
it did not seem to,133627
I just do not want,133522
he 's not going to,133289
at the same time as,133234
as he made his way,133202
"for a while , and",133184
in the middle of nowhere,133155
had been a long time,133073
"for a while , but",133013
thought he was going to,132975
have nothing to do with,132767
did not know you were,132595
that 's what you 're,132228
would never be able to,132190
"on the table , and",132036
did not want you to,131729
what appeared to be a,131693
first time in his life,131674
I 'd like to know,131582
did not seem to notice,131483
standing in front of the,131421
she had not been able,131412
you will not have to,131350
what am I going to,131348
get to the bottom of,131270
her into his arms and,131204
out of the room and,131068
could not bring herself to,130986
do not know how you,130691
not know what else to,130679
the two of them had,130618
the first time in her,130432
I do not believe that,130414
and walked out of the,130400
I was the one who,130371
"living or dead , is",130304
if he had not been,130198
it was one of those,130012
was silent for a moment,129950
want you to know that,129866
"on the floor , and",129846
on one side of the,129739
I do not understand why,129678
I was going to be,129222
they did not want to,129140
that he did not want,129087
and if you do not,128649
was the first time he,128628
his arms over his chest,128621
he looked down at the,128577
am I going to do,128499
it was only a matter,128472
all he had to do,128462
"no , I can not",128454
for the sake of the,128277
the first time he 'd,128210
really did not want to,128143
do not know if you,127970
did not need to be,127859
against the side of the,127827
we do not have a,127780
not know what to think,127720
"a long , long time",127687
and I did not know,127665
made a mental note to,127557
"for a moment , she",127417
it would be like to,127375
it could not have been,127232
in the blink of an,127224
the back of her mind,127085
are you going to tell,127053
to the right of the,127052
in the eyes of the,127034
not want to have to,127030
"may be reproduced , stored",126832
is not going to be,126809
I 'm just going to,126786
I want to know what,126776
this is the first time,126725
to get rid of the,126694
it 's not your fault,126602
for the rest of her,126526
did not know what she,126295
was nowhere to be seen,126288
in whole or in part,126194
I was not sure what,126102
could not help but smile,126089
and the two of them,126086
do not have time for,126076
in the light of the,125957
he opened the door and,125934
the head of the table,125906
in the back of my,125904
what I 'm going to,125680
I 'm not trying to,125399
the first time in a,125364
did not want to have,125324
was not sure what to,125309
he did not like the,125307
to the left of the,125259
"me , ' he said",124971
I do not believe in,124890
she would be able to,124772
you did not tell me,124604
her in his arms and,124575
was a long time ago,124556
he did not know if,124515
can not tell you how,124403
to get out of this,124364
I know what you mean,124345
as well as I do,124292
from the corner of his,124185
I do not think the,124029
could not help but feel,123923
"be reproduced , stored in",123727
trying to figure out what,123684
I feel like I 'm,123672
he looked up at the,123567
the hell is going on,123474
it was a good thing,123458
was not in the mood,123417
see what I can do,123258
do not know how much,123216
"she said , ' I",123139
the top of the hill,123076
I ' m not sure,123016
do not know why you,122955
"I told you , I",122890
you do not even know,122886
up in front of the,122766
standing in the middle of,122684
at the same time he,122680
and I do not have,122622
might not be able to,122599
a man and a woman,122459
"well , I 'm not",122454
the back of his mind,122316
the bridge of his nose,122186
I 'm not going anywhere,122072
turned to look at her,121952
to the center of the,121881
do not know if it,121878
as if he were a,121816
I did not need to,121734
but it was not the,121709
at the entrance to the,121582
it was a long time,121580
right in the middle of,121571
I do not want her,121571
on the table in front,121513
in and out of her,121337
in the midst of a,121297
it was the only way,121266
and sat down on the,121243
I can not say I,121170
in such a way that,121130
did not seem to have,121124
it would have been a,121110
did not know what was,121036
I think it 's time,120976
would not have been able,120649
the rest of the family,120237
she would not have to,120172
do not want me to,120151
"of the room , and",119920
on the edge of a,119710
he had to do was,119681
it seemed to me that,119648
could not bring himself to,119622
spent the rest of the,119499
have something to do with,119391
stored in a retrieval system,119367
at the rear of the,119307
it was time to go,119236
that 's what you want,119195
what was going to happen,119082
not have anything to do,118998
as if she had been,118863
that she did not want,118831
he looked down at her,118714
"like I said , I",118617
turned to look at him,118571
is going to be a,118499
looked at each other and,118481
we do not know what,118467
that I do not know,118155
what am I supposed to,118058
was one of the few,118023
but I do not see,118020
if you know what I,118006
I think it 's a,118005
all the way back to,117889
do not know what the,117852
I did not want you,117789
other side of the door,117777
I did not say that,117766
her arms over her chest,117724
arms around his neck and,117722
that 's a good idea,117584
I do not want it,117448
on the back of my,117376
as far as I 'm,117319
at the door of the,117298
can not wait to see,117281
was the first time I,117241
what the hell is going,117222
"are used fictitiously , and",117180
"used fictitiously , and any",117174
in the hands of the,117096
as if he had not,117091
do you think you can,117081
"fictitiously , and any resemblance",117049
we ' re going to,117036
do not think I 've,117024
as he was about to,117022
stood in the middle of,116969
as soon as they were,116959
he was not sure he,116885
you did not want to,116821
had it not been for,116688
and any resemblance to actual,116651
not want to be a,116641
are you sure you 're,116511
you have no idea how,116277
he took her hand and,116059
it was almost as if,116052
if you want me to,116047
"of the house , and",116007
might as well have been,115997
"said , shaking his head",115995
did not know whether to,115990
drew in a deep breath,115984
first time in her life,115866
head from side to side,115850
he had no intention of,115849
I 'll do my best,115776
it was hard to tell,115661
the sound of his voice,115641
wanted nothing more than to,115619
but there was no way,115613
I did not tell you,115466
the look on her face,115414
was out of the question,115392
as if she 'd been,115318
what I 'm talking about,115164
the palm of his hand,115039
I was going to say,114875
there was nothing he could,114741
on both sides of the,114693
"to her , and she",114680
what it 's like to,114659
at the top of her,114630
it 's one of the,114386
I 'll see you in,114229
he was not sure what,114196
do not want him to,114092
far as I 'm concerned,113998
on either side of her,113927
but she did not know,113836
Chapter One Chapter Two Chapter,113773
One Chapter Two Chapter Three,113733
as she made her way,113726
the way back to the,113723
a smile on his face,113688
did not know if he,113677
anything to do with the,113618
I 'm going to need,113613
I wanted to talk to,113553
was the first time she,113516
her head to the side,113516
there was no need for,113466
walked out of the room,113377
it occurred to me that,113322
why do not you tell,113239
as far as I could,113202
I ' d like to,113108
he got to his feet,113079
Chapter Two Chapter Three Chapter,113017
Two Chapter Three Chapter Four,112997
she opened her eyes and,112872
as if she were a,112821
for as long as I,112804
you 're going to get,112679
did not want to tell,112539
I was not about to,112522
if I 'm going to,112512
I 'm going to tell,112385
and I are going to,112341
she was not sure what,112251
I 'm sure it 's,112150
do you think I 'm,112135
"for a moment , I",112093
pulled up in front of,112053
made their way to the,112047
it would not have been,111945
his hands on his hips,111795
it 's not as if,111778
I would not be able,111773
